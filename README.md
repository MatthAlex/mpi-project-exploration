## Specifications

Key features implemented:

- MPI Cartesian Grid
    - 3D topology with configurable dimensions and periodicity
    - Automatic decomposition via `MPI_Dims_create`
    - Neighbor discovery using `MPI_Cart_shift`
- Halo Region Updates
    - Blocking communication via `MPI_SendRecv`
    - Static transfer buffers for real and integer types
    - Interface-based type handling
- Boundary Conditions
    - Periodic (MPI-handled), Dirichlet, Neumann
    - Integrated with MPI topology for domain boundaries
    - Parameterized boundary types per face

### Future Improvements

- Modern MPI Interface
    - Migration to `mpi_f08` for improved type safety
    - Enhanced error handling and propagation
    - Fortran 2008 submodules for implementation hiding
- Advanced Communication
    - Non-blocking halo exchanges via `MPI_Isend`/`MPI_Irecv`
    - One-sided communication options for boundaries
    - Derived datatypes for halo regions
- Development Infrastructure
    - Parallel testing framework with `fpm`
    - Distributed logging system
    - Performance benchmarking suite

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Linux OS or WSL2 via Windows
- GFortran or oneAPI Fortran compiler
- MPI/MPICH installation. Currently testing on OpenMPI v5.0.2

#### Optional

- VS Code installation
- Modern Fortran extension installation

### Step-by-step instructions

0. Load compiler modules (if using a compute cluster):

    ```sh
    module load gcc openmpi
    # or
    module load intel intelmpi
    ```

1. Create and activate a Python environment:

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Remember to activate your enviroment before runtime or development tasks.
    ```

2. Install the runtime and development packages:

    ```sh
    pip3 install .  # Install runtime dependencies from pyproject.toml
    pip3 install .[dev]  # Install development dependencies
    ```

3. Run the tests and main program:

    ```sh
    fpm test  # by default it uses gcc/gfortran to compile and run
    fpm run sendrecv_1D
    ```

## Development Tools

The template includes preconfigured development tools and settings for Modern Fortran development, with optimized configurations for:

- VS Code integration
- Language server features
- Code formatting
- Automated testing
- Package management

For detailed setup instructions and tool configurations, see [TOOLING.md](./docs/TOOLING.md).

### Profiling

For information on profiling, see [PROFILING.md](./docs/PROFILING.md).

## Documentation

Automated documentation is generated by using the [ford](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford) package. For example config files and usage, see [here](https://forddocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

To generate dcoumentation for this sample project, and then view it on the browser, run:

```sh
